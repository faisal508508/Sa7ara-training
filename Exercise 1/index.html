<h2>About me!</h2>
<p>My name is Faisal Aldubaikil, Iâ€™m in the 11th grade in Albassam schools. I am very interested in computers, and STEM subjects. ever since I was a kid I loved computers, I learned python when I was 11 to mod a game I liked, and since I lived abroad a lot I'm pretty good at English, so I joined multiple courses and volunteered at a robotics academy called Bright up, where I taught kids basic robotics and code to help them also fall in love with computers like me. I'm planning to study Software engineering as my major, although I have not decided on what university I want to go to yet, I think I want to go to ETH or Delf, and if I cannot get into Software engineering I want to do Energy engineering as I see there is a future for it.</p>
